# Flight Analysis

## Overview üõ´
Welcome to my latest project "Flight Analysis"!
<br>

It's a handy Python project I created to extract flight price data from Google Flights, to then perform some regression/supervised learning techniques to extract precious and - more importantly - actionable insights.
<br>

The main features are:
- Scraper for Google Flight results
- Data cleaner and formatter to dataframe<br>

Currently developing (also see [future implementations](#future-implementations-üìà)):

- Data collection and storage (database)
- Automation of script run
- ML technique for forecasting/clustering/predicting

## Motivation üí°
I've always loved traveling and exploring, especially in new countries with completely different cultures. I also really like data and its powerful usage.
<br>

That is why I came up with the idea of combining two of my passions into this one personal project, with the aim of showcasing my data-related skills, but also save a great part of my travel budget that I would otherwise spend buying suboptimal plane tickets.


## Usage ‚öôÔ∏è
The goal of the script is to be as easy as possible to use.
The whole project is written has been created with Python 3.11 and is based on the following libraries only:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- selenium
- tqdm
- pytest

A very simple example of the main scraping functionality could be the following (get all flight from Munich (MUC) to Los Angeles (LAX) on May 28th, 2023):
```
from google_flight_analysis.scrape import *

flights = Scrape("MUC", "LAX", "2023-05-28")
flights.data
```

The following lines would produce this output:
